In this study, all the data utilized was obtained from public datasets. There are four main sources of datasets: First, datasets from the United States Census Bureau, including 1) geodatabases of 2020 TIGER/Line shapefiles for US Geographical boundaries at CBG level (https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/2020/geo), which were used to determine the exact location and boundaries of CBG in 40 US Counties, 2) Demographic information dataset from the decennial census for 2020 (https://data.census.gov), containing CBG-level population, racial/ethnic percentage, income and vehicle availability information, which were used to preliminary linear regression and statistical analysis; second, the air temperature data of contiguous U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which contains air temperature data of 344 climate divisions since 1895 (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring /climate-at-a-glance), and we collected the average summer June-August air temperature data between 2014-2023; third, the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Enterprise Data Warehouse CONUSS TCC 2016 NLCD dataset (https://www.mrlc.gov/), which contains 30m*30m accuracy tree canopy cover data, we used these data to represent TCGS supplement and aggerated them at the CBG-level in our study area; fourth, datasets from OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org), which is widely used for academic purposes52, including 1) public facilities dataset, which contains NERPE and ERPE information, including location and area, 2) road networks dataset, which contains road networks both in the walking and driving scenarios, they were all used to calculate the shortest travel time and accessibility between each pair of CBG and PCE.
